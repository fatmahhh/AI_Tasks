the conditions of code to be cleaned :
 -Naming Conventions
            # This is bad
           # represents the number of active users
               au = 55

          # This is good
              active_user_amount = 55

 -Use nouns for variable names
 - Use descriptive-revealing names
         # This is bad
           c = 5
           d = 12

         # This is good
            city_counter = 5
            elapsed_time_in_days = 12

 -Avoid using ambiguous abbreviations
         # This is bad
             fna = 'Bob'
             cre_tmstp = 1621535852

         # This is good
             first_name = 'Bob'
             creation_timestamp = 1621535852
 
 -Always use the same vocabulary
       # This is bad
            client_first_name = 'Bob'
            customer_last_name = 'Smith'

      # This is good
           client_first_name = 'Bob'
           client_last_name = 'Smith'
 
-Use verbs for function names
        
 -Do not use different words for the same concept
            # This is bad
                def get_name(): pass
                def fetch_age(): pass

          # This is good
               def get_name(): pass
               def get_age(): pass

 -Functions should only perform a single task
        # This is bad
             def fetch_and_display_personnel():
               data = # ...

               for person in data:
                  print(person)

       # This is good
            def fetch_personnel():
                return # ...

            def display_personnel(data):
               for person in data:
                  print(person)
